# SNAP Accounts interview Task

## Stretch goals and further considerations
- Use a DTO to filter sensitive data from Unauthorized users
- Create policies and scopes to allow for multiple tiers of authorization
- Assign TTL to JWT tokens and create a Refresh Token to manage these JWTs (Can't have API tokens that last forever!)
- Seperate auth server on Azure Cloud for managing JWT tokens and refresh keys
- SSL (https) checks
- Swagger integration for documentation?
